TODO
====
- don't spin when paused
- having the same characters in a row is confusing (echo '生生化化本無涯' | go run .)
- seeking with arrows across paragraphs
- implement search that shows context
- switch text to be an array of runes instead
    skipPastCharacter and everything else will be much simpler
- pause longer on newline
